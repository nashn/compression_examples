ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
---------------
The code presentes in this project are originally from the book <Practical Algorithms for Programmers> by Andrew Binstock and John Rex

The code is used as an testing reference to compare our own solution for our course project in CS165. In the results file, there are two different files contain results of using both Huffman and LZW to encode and decode on our benchmark files. These benchmark files can be found in the testcases file.

There is also a report from the book attached, which briefly introduces the differences and efficiencies among these compression algorithm. For full detailed report, please check the book. This report is only used for educational purpose for our group projects.

Comments
--------
The book is published in 1995 and my friend found it in the library by chance.
Since the book contains exact information we need for the project, we are looking forward to see whether the algorithms and codes will work.
Originally we did not have much faith on the codes in the book since it is so old, but it turns out that we were wrong. Amazingly, the code we copy from the book still work perfectly even after about 20 years. It is an evidence to prove that true knowledge will never behind the times.
